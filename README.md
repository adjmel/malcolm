`ft_malcolm` is a C project to demonstrate how ARP spoofing works at a low network level using raw sockets.

‚ö° **This tool must be tested inside a Virtual Machine (VM)** and used in a safe lab environment for learning purposes.

---

## üìö Description

`ft_malcolm` listens for ARP requests and sends forged ARP replies on your local network.

You can:

- Select a **source IP** and **source MAC** (the spoofed identity).
- Define the **target IP** and **target MAC** (the victim machine).
- When the victim sends an ARP request (for example by using `ping`), `ft_malcolm` replies with the spoofed data.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation

Compile the project using:

```bash
make
```

This will generate an executable:

```bash
./ft_malcolm
```

---

## üíª Usage

**Run the program with administrator rights**:

```bash
sudo ./ft_malcolm <source_ip> <source_mac> <target_ip> <target_mac>
```

(linux : ip a, MACOS : ifconfig)

---

‚úÖ **Testing Procedure:**

1. Launch the program inside a Virtual Machine.
2. On the target machine (victim), use:

```bash
ping <source_ip>
```

3. `ft_malcolm` will detect the ARP request and send a forged ARP reply to the target.


<!--To avoid pinging an existing IP address, I look at which network the IP address of my host machine is located in, then I spoof an unassigned IP address in this same network.
ex : ip host : 10.12.3.7/16 
ex : sudo ./ft_malcolm 10.12.3.255 08:00:27:de:d9:01 10.12.3.7 00:be:43:9c:44:38 -->
